## Wireframes

### MVP/PostMVP

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP. 

#### MVP 
*These are examples only. Replace with your own MVP features.*

- Find and use external api 
- Render data on page 
- Allow user to click to see or hide nutrition data

#### PostMVP  

- Allow user to create a list of future burgers to try.
- Allow the user either delete the burger selection if they no longer want to try to cook it or if they didn't like it after they cooked it.
- Allow the user to create a favorite list to revisit by using local storage to save burger info.

## Project Schedule

## Priority Matrix
![alt text]https://github.com/Deleon06/Hot_Burger_Summer/blob/main/Priority%20Matrix%20Template.xlsx%20-%20Task%20Priority%20Matrix.pdf
## Timeframes

Tell us how long you anticipate spending on each area of development. Be sure to consider how many hours a day you plan to be coding and how many days you have available until presentation day.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Throughout your project, keep track of your Time Invested and Actual Time and update your README regularly.

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Adding Form | H | 10hrs| N/A | N/A |
| Working with API | H | 6hrs| N/A | N/A |

| JavaScript Functions| H | 8hrs| N/A | N/A |
| Research Local Storage | L | 3hrs | N/A | N/A |
| Implementing Local Storage | L | 3hrs | N/A | N/A |
